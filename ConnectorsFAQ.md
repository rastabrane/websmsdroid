## What connector should I use? ##
Please see the [ConnectorMatrix](ConnectorMatrix.md).

## Is it possible to build a Connector for provider x? ##

If there is any way to send sms via web with your provider,
it should be possible to code a connector for WebSMS as well.
If there is any kind of web API, it is very simple to do so.

## Will you support a Connector for provider x? ##

Please get a coder of your choice to do so.
Please have a look at the [DeveloperHelp](DeveloperHelp.md).
It is very easy to build a new Connector.

If something is unclear, I'm willing to help while developing your connector.

WebSMS and all my other apps are spare time projects.
I'm not able to code a connector for every provider out there.

## I can't find a coder to code my Connector. Please do the work for me. ##

If your provider provides a web API and there is an account for testing ready for me,
I might code it for you.
